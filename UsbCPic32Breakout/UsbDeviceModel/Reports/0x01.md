# I<sup>2</sup>C - Command Acknowledgement
Report Type: Interrupt IN<br />
Report Size: 7 Bytes

| Report ID | Acknowledged Report ID | Status                      | Arguments |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| 00000001  | 1 byte                 | `n`&nbsp;`i`&nbsp;`ccccccc` | 4 bytes   |

If an OUT Report does not have its own dedicated acknowledgement report(s) then this will be the default response to any of the commands that the Host sends to the
device.  The Acknowledgement Report will be sent to the Host on the Interrupt IN endpoint that corresponds to the interface where the initial command was sent.

## Report ID
HID Report ID.  Always `0x01`.

## Acknowledged Report ID
The ID of the OUT Report sent by the Host that is being ACK'd or NACK'd.  Note that the order of responses to commands is not necessarily in the same order as they
are received so you must only send one command of a given type to an interface at a time and wait for its acknowledgement.

## Status and Arguments
The status of the command that was executed:

| Bits      | Direction | Meaning                                                                                                   |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `n`       | IN        | Negative Acknowledgement flag; `1` if the command is NACK'd (an error), or `0` if it is ACK'd (no error). |
| `i`       | IN        | Interface-specific (ie. non-generic) error code if `1`, else a generic error code if `0`.                 |
| `ccccccc` | IN        | A status code to give more meaning to the ACK or NACK; see below.                                         |

### Generic ACK Status Codes

| Code | Arguments             | Meaning                                        |
|------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00 | Reserved (All Zeroes) | Success - the command executed without errors. |

### Generic NACK Status Codes

| Code | Arguments             | Meaning                                          |
|------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 0x01 | Reserved (All Zeroes) | Unknown report ID.                               |
| 0x02 | Reserved (All Zeroes) | Queue full (probably too many requests pending). |
| 0x03 | Reserved (All Zeroes) | Index, offset or address is out of bounds.       |
| 0x10 | Reserved (All Zeroes) | Invalid [Unlock Key](../Core/Reports/0x04.md).   |
