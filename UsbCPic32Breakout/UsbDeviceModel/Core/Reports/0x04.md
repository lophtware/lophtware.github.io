## Report ID
HID Report ID.  Always `0x04`.

## Unlock Key
An 8-byte key that is used to prevent accidental changes to certain configuration values.  For a factory-reset
device this is all zeroes, otherwise it is the key stored in the currently active configuration's volatile
memory, which in turn is loaded from the configuration's non-volatile storage when set.

## New Unlock Key
An 8-byte key that will replace the current *`Unlock Key`*.

## Notes
The *`Unlock Key`* value is used to prevent accidental changes to certain configuration items that may adversely
affect the device functionality, such as pin assignments.  The key is stored in the volatile memory (ie. RAM) and
not persisted to non-volatile flash until a [Store Current Configuration](0x08.md) command is issued.  This means
that it is possible to issue a temporary key that will be forgotten once the device has been power-cycled or another
configuration has been activated.
