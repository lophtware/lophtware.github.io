| Report ID            | Unlock Key | Suspend Behaviour                        | Interface ID     | Function ID | Function Arguments |

**THIS COMMAND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DESTROY THE DEVICE AND / OR CONNECTED CIRCUITRY, IE. BY SHORT-CIRCUITING TWO OUTPUTS TOGETHER.**

## Report ID
HID Report ID.  Always `0x44`.

The _Pin Configuration_ report IDs all follow this encoding scheme:

| Bits   | Direction | Meaning                                                                     |
|--------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01     |           |                                                                             |
| `bb`   | IN / OUT  | Bank number; `00` for *A*, `01` for *B*, `10` for *C* and `11` is reserved. |
| `pppp` | IN / OUT  | The pin's index into the bank.                                              |

For example, pin *B0* is `01` `0000`, *C9* is `10` `1001`, etc.  Thus *A4* is `00` `0100`.  Undefined pins give invalid
report IDs and so will result in a Negative [Command Acknowledgement](0x01.md) response.  No changes will be made in this instance.

## Unlock Key
An 8-byte key that is compared against a [previously stored value](../../ControlEndpoint/Reports/0x01.md).
This mechanism prevents accidental in-circuit re-configuration of a pin, which could adversely affect
the device or connected circuit.

If the given key does not match the one stored against the configuration then the command will have no effect and a Negative
[Command Acknowledgement](0x01.md) will be returned.

For an IN Report this will be all zeroes.

## Suspend Behaviour
The behaviour of the pin when the device enters Suspend.

| Bits  | Direction | Meaning                                                                                                        |
|-------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ss`  | IN / OUT  | Suspend behaviour; `00` for unchanged, `01` to switch to input, `10` to output low, `11` to output high.       |
| `r`   | IN / OUT  | Remote Wake-Up; `0` to disable, `1` to wake from Suspend when a transition occurs on the pin.                  |
| 00    |           |                                                                                                                |
| `o`   | IN / OUT  | Output type; `0` for push-pull, `1` for open-drain.                                                            |
| `wp`  | IN / OUT  | Weak Pulls; `00` for none, `01` for pull-down, `10` for pull-up, `11` is reserved but will enable the pull-up. |

| `iiii` | IN / OUT  | An ID for the pin, in the range `[0, 10]`.  This is useful for assigning application-specific weights to the pins, for example during [parallel value outputs](0x04.md). |

It is not possible to assign the same ID to multiple pins - the pin assigned last 'wins'.  The default mapping is:

| A2 | A3 | A4 | B0 | B1 | B2 | B3 | B4 | B5 | B7 | C9 |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 |

|-------------|--------------------|
| `????????`  | TODO !             |

TIMER1 cannot use any pins for clock or gate input.  Triggers or resets would be possible though.
TIMER2 cannot use any pins for clock or gate input.  Triggers or resets would be possible though.
TIMER3 can use RC9 as clock input.

### [0x02 - CCP (Capture / Compare / PWM)](../../Ccp/Interface.md)
There are 9 CCP peripherals available for use and configuration.  The first 3 are *MCCP* (Multiple CCP), meaning they can provide multiple outputs,
and the remaining 6 are *SCCP* (Single CCP), meaning they can only provide a single output.

MCCP peripherals provide up to 6 outputs, labelled `[A, F]`.  Not all outputs are available for use and configuration.

Any pin can be assigned to this interface but some functions require dedicated pins.

#### MCCP1 Output C
The pin is assigned to the *C* Output.  Only *A2* can be assigned to this function.

### [0x03 - USB (Universal Serial Bus)](../../Usb/Interface.md)<a name="usb" />
Any pin can be assigned to this interface.

#### Status Flags
The pin is assigned to the Status Flags function which provides information on the state of the USB cable, connector and protocol.
Any pin can be assigned to this function.  Multiple pins can be assigned to this function, each with independent parameters.

Multiple flags can be combined together into a single output pin using either an AND or an OR operation.  Flags can also be inverted
prior to the combining operation.  This scheme provides a very flexible method of signalling USB state to connected circuitry.
For example, it is possible to have a pin indicating the condition of _NOT attached to a dedicated charger AND the device can source a current of at least 100mA_.
