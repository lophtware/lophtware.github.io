## Port LSB
The Least Significant Byte of a word that represents a mask of the state of the pin latches.  The 11 bits in the mask correspond to the user-defined IDs provided
by the [Pin Configuration (A2)](0x42.md)-[Pin Configuration (C9)](0x69.md) commands.

## Latch MSB
The Most Significant Byte of a word that represents a mask of the state of the pin latches.  The 11 bits in the mask correspond to the user-defined IDs provided
by the [Pin Configuration (A2)](0x42.md)-[Pin Configuration (C9)](0x69.md) commands.

## Port LSB
The Least Significant Byte of a word that represents a mask of the state of the pins.  The 11 bits in the mask correspond to the user-defined IDs provided by the
[Pin Configuration (A2)](0x42.md)-[Pin Configuration (C9)](0x69.md) commands.

## Port MSB
The Most Significant Byte of a word that represents a mask of the state of the pins.  The 11 bits in the mask correspond to the user-defined IDs provided by the
[Pin Configuration (A2)](0x42.md)-[Pin Configuration (C9)](0x69.md) commands.

## Change LSB
The Least Significant Byte of a word that represents a mask of which pins have changed.  The 11 bits in the mask correspond to the user-defined IDs provided by
the [Pin Configuration (A2)](0x42.md)-[Pin Configuration (C9)](0x69.md) commands.

## Change MSB
The Most Significant Byte of a word that represents a mask of which pins have changed.  The 11 bits in the mask correspond to the user-defined IDs provided by
the [Pin Configuration (A2)](0x42.md)-[Pin Configuration (C9)](0x69.md) commands.

## First Timestamp
The value of the microcontroller's `COUNT` register when the first change was detected.  The `COUNT` register increments at a rate of 12MHz, so each LSb is
approximately 83.333ns.

This field is *Little Endian*, ie. the Least Significant Byte of the word appears first.  Bit numbering within the constituent bytes is unaffected.

## Second Timestamp
The value of the microcontroller's `COUNT` register when the ports were sampled, which is just before this report is sent.  Depending on how busy the
microcontroller is processing other tasks, this could be many milliseconds after *_First Timestamp_*.  The `COUNT` register increments at a rate of 12MHz, so each
LSb is approximately 83.333ns.

This field is *Little Endian*, ie. the Least Significant Byte of the word appears first.  Bit numbering within the constituent bytes is unaffected.

## Notes
The port sampling operation is not atomic so it is possible that there are changes during the sampling operations that means there are mismatches in the reported
*_Latch_*, *_Port_* and *_Change_* masks.  If this happens then the values of the *_Latch_* and *_Port_* fields are not reliable for the corresponding
*_Change_* mask, in which case the `s` bit will be `0` and another [Pins Changed](0x18.md) IN Report will be sent.

The 11 bits in the *_Latch_*, *_Port_* and *_Change_* masks correspond to the user-defined IDs provided by the
[Pin Configuration (A2)](0x42.md)-[Pin Configuration (C9)](0x69.md) commands.
