# Core - Pin Parallel Status
Report Type: IN / Interrupt IN<br />
Report Size: 6 Bytes<br />

| Report ID | Flags            | Latch Mask LSB | Latch Mask MSB   | Port Mask LSB | Port Mask MSB    |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| 00010110  | 0000000&nbsp;`r` | `llllllll`     | 00000&nbsp;`lll` | `pppppppp`    | 00000&nbsp;`ppp` |

## Report ID
HID Report ID.  Always `0x16`.

## Flags
| Bits    | Direction | Meaning                                                                                                                   |

| 0000000 |           |                                                                                                                           |
| `r`     | IN        | Response flag; `1` if this report is in response to an OUT Report, or `0` if it is periodic or was requested by the Host. |

## Latch Mask LSB
The Least Significant Byte of the pin _latch_ mask; this is what is being driven out of the pin, if it is an output.

## Latch Mask MSB
The Most Significant Byte of the pin _latch_ mask; this is what is being driven out of the pin, if it is an output.

## Port Mask LSB
The Least Significant Byte of the pin _port_ mask; this is what value is actually on the pin, if it is an input or an output.

## Port Mask MSB
The Most Significant Byte of the pin _port_ mask; this is what value is actually on the pin, if it is an input or an output.

# Notes
This command reads the values from the pin latches and ports.  Any pins that are assigned to other interfaces will read as `0` in both.

The 11 bits in the mask correspond to the user-defined IDs provided by the [Pin Configuration (A2)](0x42.md)-[Pin Configuration (C9)](0x69.md) commands.
