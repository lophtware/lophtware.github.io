# USB - Configuration Name Descriptor
Report Type: IN / OUT<br />
Report Size: 32 Bytes<br />
Acknowledged By: [Command Acknowledgement](0x01.md)

| Report ID | Flags            | Name     |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| 00000100  | `u`&nbsp;0000000 | 32 bytes |

## Report ID
HID Report ID.  Always `0x04`.

## Flags
| Bits | Direction | Meaning                                                                                                             |
|------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `u`  | OUT       | Whether to update the descriptor; `1` to update it, `0` to leave it alone.  For IN Reports this will always be `0`. |

## Name
Unicode (UTF-16) representation of the configuration's name.  There is space for 16 characters in Little Endian notation (Least-Significant Byte first).
Any unused characters should be set to `0x0000` and the string is considered terminated by the first occurrence of a `0x0000` character.

## Notes
The name cannot be zero-length (ie. the first two bytes both `0x00`), otherwise a Negative [Command Acknowledgement](0x01.md) will be returned in response.

The descriptor will not be stored into non-volatile storage until a [Store Current Configuration](../Core/Reports/0x08.md) command is issued, so any
subsequent `Get_String_Descriptor` requests will continue to return the old descriptor, and any `Set_Configuration` requests or power cycles will lose the
changes.
