## Report ID
HID Report ID.  Always `0x16` for OUT Reports.

IN Reports can use the `I` flag to indicate whether the Host should receive the immediate values of the Master peripheral (when `I` is `1`) or whether the Host
should receive the configuration settings (when `I` is `0`).

## Unlock Key
An 8-byte key that is used to prevent accidental changes to certain configuration values.  If the supplied key does not match the stored key then this report is ignored.

For IN Reports the field is set as all zeroes.

## Common Flags
These flags are common across multiple fields and have the same semantics for each:

| Bits | Direction | Meaning                                                                                                                       |
|------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `u`  | OUT       | Update the field; `1` if the field is to be updated, `0` if no change is to be made (any supplied values will be ignored).  For IN Reports this will be set to `0`. |
| `i`  | OUT       | Immediate update; `1` if an update is to be applied immediately, `0` if the change will be stored in the configuration to be applied later.  Note that no configuration changes are persisted until [Store Current Configuration](../../Core/Reports/0x08.md) is issued.  This flag makes no sense if `u` is `0`, so will be ignored.  For IN Reports this will be set to `0`. |

## Baud Rate
This field is the value given to the SPI Baud Rate Generator and directly specifies the spacing of the bits put onto the bus for the given slave.  The desired
value can be in the range `[0, 8191]` (values outside this range will be clamped) and relates to the clock frequency by the formula
_F<sub>clk</sub> = F<sub>pc</sub> / (2 * *`Baud Rate`* + 1)_.  See the notes below on F<sub>clk</sub> and F<sub>pc</sub>.

This field is *Little Endian*, ie. the Least Significant Byte of the word appears first.  Bit numbering within the constituent bytes is unaffected.

### About Throughput
The PIC operates at a pipelined instruction rate of 24MHz so clearly a 12MHz maximum SPI clock frequency can only be used in bursts (not strictly true since DMA
channels can be leveraged in an auto-restarting mode but for the purposes of this application that is not feasible).  The default firmware uses DMA to transfer
up to 1KiB of data to and from memory so transfers from the Host to an SPI Slave are limited to 1023 bytes.  Using the USB HID protocol, 1023 bytes will take 17
frames to transfer - approximately 17ms.

Transfers from an SPI Slave to the Host can be up to 65535 bytes but the limiting factor for throughput will again be the USB HID interface which can transfer at
most 64 bytes per millisecond (64kB per second) for the factory firmware, before the overhead for the report headers are taken into account.  This means that for
high SPI clock frequencies the data transfer will be paused when the buffer is full whilst the buffer is transferred to the Host.  For _Framed_ SPI modes the
clock will continue to run; for regular SPI modes the clock will be in its idle state.  In both modes the _Slave Select_ line will not be released until the
entire transaction has been completed.

Theoretically the 12MHz SPI port could transfer stereo 16-bit ADC samples at 375kHz although the PIC would not be able to process them other than to pass them
to another serial port via DMA transfers.  Using the USB HID interface with the default factory firmware you're probably looking at more on the order of
16kHz stereo 16-bit ADC samples maximum, probably a few kHz less.  You could achieve significantly better than this with custom firmware that processes the
samples or uses a different USB protocol, or even HID and multiple endpoints.

### Peripheral Clock Frequency, Fpc (MHz)
The Peripheral Clock Frequency, _Fpc_, is the input clock to the SPI Baud Rate Generator and is derived from the internal RC oscillator.  The datasheet
specifies a variation of +/- 2% over process, voltage and temperature, although when locked to the USB Frame Packets the variation can be as little as +/- 0.2%:

| Min   | Typ   | Max   |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 23.52 | 24.00 | 24.48 |

### SPI Clock Frequency, Fclk (MHz)
Because each slave has its own _Slave Select_ line the properties on the bus, such as clock rate, can be set for each of the slaves individually.  The frequency
of the clock line will vary with the _Peripheral Clock Frequency_ which is nominally 24MHz.  The various formulae are given in the table below:

| Bus Clock Frequency, MHz | Formula                                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Minimum                  | Fpc<sub>min</sub> / (2 * `Baud Rate`) + 1) |
| Typical                  | Fpc<sub>typ</sub> / (2 * `Baud Rate`) + 1) |
| Maximum                  | Fpc<sub>max</sub> / (2 * `Baud Rate`) + 1) |

Some sample `Baud Rate` values have been calculated for convenience:

| `Baud Rate` | Minimum (kHz) | Typical (kHz) | Maximum CLK (kHz) |
|------------:|--------------:|--------------:|------------------:|
| 0           | 11760.00      | 12000.00      | 12240.00          |
| 11          | 980.00        | 1000.00       | 1020.00           |
| 23          | 490.00        | 500.00        | 510.00            |
| 119         | 98.00         | 100.00        | 102.00            |
| 1199        | 9.80          | 10.00         | 10.20             |
| 8191        | 1.43          | 1.46          | 1.50              |

## Clock Flags

| Bits | Direction | Meaning                                                                                                                                                           |
|------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `p`  | IN / OUT  | Polarity; `1` if the _Idle_ state is high, `0` if the idle state is low.                                                                                          |
| `e`  | IN / OUT  | Edge output; `1` if MOSI changes when the clock transitions from from _Active_ to _Idle_, `0` if MOSI changes when the clock transitions from _Idle_ to _Active_. |

## Mode Flags
The *`Mode Flags`* field determines the operating mode of the SPI peripheral.  It affects transfers differently depending on whether the peripheral is operating
in _Audio Mode_ (see below) or not.  For regular SPI transfers *`Mode Flags`* can have the following values:

| Mode (`mm`) | Data Width       |
|-------------|------------------|
| 00          | 8-bit transfers  |
| 01          | 16-bit transfers |
| 10          | 32-bit transfers |
| 11          | 32-bit transfers |

When the SPI peripheral is in _Audio Mode_ the bits will have the following effect:

| Mode (`mm`) | Data Width | Channel Width | Frame Width |
|-------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| 00          | 16 bits    | 16 bits       | 32 bits     |
| 01          | 16 bits    | 32 bits       | 64 bits     |
| 10          | 32 bits    | 32 bits       | 64 bits     |
| 11          | 24 bits    | 32 bits       | 64 bits     |

## MISO Flags

| Bits | Direction | Meaning                                                                                                                                                           |
|------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `S`  | IN / OUT  | Sign-extend; `1` if the MISO values are to be sign-extended, `0` if not.                                  |
| `s`  | IN / OUT  | Sample point; `1` if MISO is sampled at the end of the output period, `0` if it is sampled in the middle. |

## Frame Synchronisation Flags

| Bits | Direction | Meaning                                                                                                                                                           |
|------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `n`  | IN / OUT  | Enabled; `1` if the frame pulse is enabled, `0` if the frame pulse is disabled.                                       |
| `w`  | IN / OUT  | Width; `1` if the frame pulse is one character wide, `0` if the frame pulse is one clock wide.                        |
| `P`  | IN / OUT  | Polarity; `1` if the frame pulse is active-high, `0` if the frame pulse is active-low.                                |
| `E`  | IN / OUT  | Edge; `1` if the frame pulse coincides with the first bit clock, `0` if the frame pulse precedes the first bit clock. |

## Frame Synchronisation Counter

This field is updated depending on the *`u`* and *`i`* flags of the *`Frame Synchronisation Flags`* field.  It contains the number of characters between
frame pulses and has one of the following values:

| Bits (`fff`) | Meaning                                                                          |
