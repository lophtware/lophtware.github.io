## Report ID
HID Report ID.  Always `0x40`.

## Flags
| Bits    | Direction | Meaning                                                                                                                       |
|---------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `d`     | OUT       | `1` if the first *`rrrrr`* bytes of MISO are discarded from the payload returned to the Host; `0` if they are to be included. |
| `rrrrr` | OUT       | The number of *`Payload`* bytes that will be shifted onto the MOSI line.                                                      |
| `sss`   | OUT       | The Slave Select line that is asserted.  The valid range is `[0, 7]`.                                                         |
| `tt`    | OUT       | When *`Count`* is `0` this is the ID of the (pre-configured) termination condition to use; otherwise it should be `00`.       |
| `a`     | OUT       | `1` if the Slave Select line remains asserted after the transfer; `0` if the Slave Select line is reset to its default state. |

## Count
The number of bytes that will be shifted from the MISO line (the Slave) and returned to the Host.  If *`Count`* is `0` then the input is continuous and will
only terminate once the (pre-configured) termination condition specified by *`tt`* occurs.  The size of the payloads returned to the host are configured
on a per-Slave basis along with the other bus properties.

This field is *Little Endian*, ie. the Least Significant Byte of the word appears first.  Bit numbering within the constituent bytes is unaffected.

## Payload
A block of 31 bytes that will be shifted onto the MOSI line.  Bits are shifted MSb-first.  Only the first *`rrrrr`* bytes are shifted, the rest are ignored.

If *`Count`* is less than *`rrrrr`* when *`d`* is `0` then the SPI Clock line will be pulsed `8 * `*`rrrrr`* times, but only the first *`Count`* bytes will be
returned to the Host in the resulting IN report; ie. the minimum number of clock pulses on the SPI bus is always `8 * max( 1, `*`rrrrr`*`)`.
