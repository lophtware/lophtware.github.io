# SPI - Command Acknowledgement
Report Type: Interrupt IN<br />
Report Size: 7 Bytes

| Report ID | Acknowledged Report ID | Status                     | Arguments |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| 00000001  | 1 byte                 | `n`&nbsp;`i`&nbsp;`cccccc` | 4 bytes   |

If an OUT Report does not have its own dedicated acknowledgement report(s) then this will be the default response to any of the commands that the Host sends to the
device.

## Report ID
HID Report ID.  Always `0x01`.

## Acknowledged Report ID
The ID of the [SPI HID Reports](../Hid.md) that is being ACK'd or NACK'd.  Note that the order of responses to commands is not necessarily in the same
order as they are received so you must only send one command of a given type to an interface at a time and wait for its acknowledgement.

## Status and Arguments
The status of the command that was executed:

| Bits     | Direction | Meaning                                                                                                   |
|----------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `n`      | IN        | Negative Acknowledgement flag; `1` if the command is NACK'd (an error), or `0` if it is ACK'd (no error). |
| `i`      | IN        | Interface-specific (ie. non-generic) error code if `1`, else a generic error code if `0`.                 |
| `cccccc` | IN        | A status code to give more meaning to the ACK or NACK; see below.                                         |

### ACK Status Codes
As well as the generic codes defined in [Report Acknowledgement](../../Reports/0x01.md), the following interface-specific values are defined:

| Code | Arguments             | Meaning                                        |
|------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| None |                       |                                                |

### NACK Status Codes
As well as the generic codes defined in [Report Acknowledgement](../../Reports/0x01.md), the following interface-specific values are defined:

| Code | Arguments             | Meaning                                                      |
|------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| None |                       |                                                              |
