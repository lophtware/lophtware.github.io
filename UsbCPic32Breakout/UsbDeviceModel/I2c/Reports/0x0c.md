# I<sup>2</sup>C - Slave Transaction Done
Report Type: Interrupt IN<br />
Report Size: 7 Bytes

| Report ID | Flags            | Device Address   | Register Address LSB | Register Address MSB | Register Count LSB   | Register Count MSB   |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|

## Report ID
HID Report ID.  Always `0x0c`.

## Flags

| Bits     | Direction | Meaning                                                                                 |
|----------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `w`      | IN        | Transaction type; `1` if a Master wrote to the Slave, `0` a Master read from the Slave. |

## Device Address
The I<sup>2</sup>C address of the device that the Master was using to access it as a Slave.

## Register Address LSB
The Least Significant Byte of the address of the first register involved in the transaction.

## Register Address MSB
The Most Significant Byte of the address of the first register involved in the transaction.  Note that `BBBBBB` is the _Bank_ number and `AA` are
the two most significant bits of the address in that bank.  See the [I<sup>2</sup>C Behaviour](../../I2c/Index.md) page for information on what
banks are available.

## Register Count LSB
The Least Significant Byte of the number of registers involved in the transaction.

## Register Count MSB
The Most Significant Byte of the number of registers involved in the transaction.

## Notes
Note that it is possible (but unlikely) that a Master has tried to access more than 65535 registers in a single transaction.  Since the I<sup>2</sup>C
address space implemented by the Slave firmware is only 64KiB it is pointless trying to record more than this, since every single register will have been
touched in the process.  Thus, *`Register Count`* will not overflow.

These reports can be turned on and off via the [Slave Report Configuration](0x0a.md) command.
