# I<sup>2</sup>C - Protected ROM Address Mask (Slave)
Report Type: IN / OUT<br />
Report Size: 3 Bytes

| Report ID | Mask LSB   | Mask MSB                 |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------|
| 00011000  | `mmmmmmmm` | `z`&nbsp;00000&nbsp;`mm` |

## Report ID
HID Report ID.  Always `0x18`.

## Mask
The 10-bit address mask that represents the 'protected' (read-only) area of the ROM Bank.  This stops any I<sup>2</sup>C Masters writing to portions of
the ROM whilst they are accessing the device as a Slave.  It does not affect writes via the USB.  See the [I<sup>2</sup>C ROM Bank](../../../I2c/RomBank.md)
page for more information.

Note that using the mask scheme the byte at address `0x000` is always writable, ie. it cannot be protected.  This is the purpose of the `z` flag, which when
set to `1` will prevent writes to `0x000` as well.

This field is *Little Endian*, ie. the Least Significant Byte of the word appears first.  Bit numbering within the constituent bytes is unaffected.
