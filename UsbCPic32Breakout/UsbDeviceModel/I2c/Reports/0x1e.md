**THIS COMMAND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DESTROY THE DEVICE AND / OR CONNECTED CIRCUITRY, IE. BY CORRUPTING THE FIRMWARE IF THE POWER IS INTERRUPTED.**

## Report ID
HID Report ID.  Always `0x1e`.

## Unlock Key
An 8-byte key that is used to prevent accidental changes to certain configuration values.  If the supplied key does not match the stored key then this report is ignored.

For IN Reports the field is set as all zeroes.

## Offset LSB
The Least Significant Byte of a word that is the offset into the 1024-byte ROM array.

For an IN Report this is always `0x00`.

## Offset MSB
The Most Significant Byte of a word that is the offset into the 1024-byte ROM array.

For an IN Report this is always `0x00`.

## Count LSB
The Least Significant Byte of a word that is the length of the *`Contents`* field to copy into the ROM array.

For an IN Report this is always `0x00`.

## Count MSB
The Most Significant Byte of a word that is the length of the *`Contents`* field to copy into the ROM array.

For an IN Report this is always `0x04`.

## Contents
An array of 1024 bytes, of which only the first *`Count`* are significant, that will be copied into the ROM array.

## Notes
This command stores the given bytes into the ROM that is accessible to the I<sup>2</sup>C Slaves.  It is part of the non-volatile flash
memory so that the contents are persisted across power cycles.

This command should not be used if the I<sup>2</sup>C bus is in use, so ensure any Slaves are inactive and that there are no pending
Master transactions.  Slaves will experience a locked-up bus, and the USB endpoint will be halted if there are any pending Master
transactions - a USB Reset will be needed to recover from this state.

This command will reset the microcontroller so the USB connection will be lost and will proceed through enumeration again.  This means
that if any other configuration was not saved then it will be lost in the power cycle.

There are lots of things that can go wrong with this command since the PIC does not allow flash programming in anything less than
2048 byte pages.  The device pins will remain unchanged during the store operation and the power should be clean, stable and not
interrupted.  If the operation does not complete successfully then the flash contents will be corrupted.  Providing the failure was
not because due to exceeding the flash erase-write endurance limits, another attempt at this command should fix the problem.  A
re-flash of the firmware - see [ICSP](../../../Icsp.md) - should not ordinarily be required.  But any I<sup>2</sup>C Slaves
depending on specific ROM contents probably won't be happy.

The success (or otherwise) of the operation can be checked via the [Device Status](0x02.md) command once the device has been reset.
Device Status is also available via the [I<sup>2</sup>C Device Information Bank](../../I2c/../../I2c/DeviceInformationBank.md).
Any 'expected' errors, such as an invalid *`Count`*, will be negatively acknowledged with a [Command Acknowledgement](0x01.md) response
prior to the Flash erase sequence starting.  In this scenario no device reset or update will take place.
